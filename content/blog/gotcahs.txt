Lambda array function vs old function dealing with currying

Colours get duplicated when programatically creating the tag chips for searching 
- all use the last colour defined, scoping error?

[X] Blind Confidence 

0) “Done is better than perfect.” — Sheryl Sandberg
 - But what does it mean for you?

1) Why you should care about the software delivery lifecycle

2) How to ask for help

3) Be like water, Be like glue. 
 - Being a good developer doesn't mean just coding. More importantly, not coding for a few days or even a sprint doesn't make you a bad developer.
(If the time calls for it).
 - Be fluid like water. Support the team like glue. 

4) DevOps doesn't mean Jack-of-all-Trades developer. Or does it?
 - When I first started getting into this DevOps thing I was complaining I was just a Jack of all trades developer

Just because you _can_ do something doesn't mean you should do or have to. Don't be pigeonholed.

 Maintain a healthy level of ignorance and abstraction in your learning
- helps you learn a lot of different things
