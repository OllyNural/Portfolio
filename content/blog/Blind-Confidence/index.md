As developers, we often get put in difficult situations. Whether its finding solutions to distinct and interesting problems, designing complex architecture and code or pushing back on extra features - the list is endless. However, these questions have answers and are approachable. We can ask team members or push back with the help of managers and scrum masters. But what about difficult situations where we don't even know the problem? 

More importantly, how can we _cope_ when faced with them?

## Blind Confidence

> Disclaimer time. As developers, I believe we have a duty to ourselves to push ourselves and learn new technologies and standards. However, this should always come with a good support network, and at a frequency that fits the individual. <span class="blogpost-highlighted">Always put more focus on mental health over productivity and delivering work.</span> I discuss this more below, in the Comfort Zones section.

###Â Story Time
There I was, a fresh, wide-eyed and eager graduate full of enthusiasm and energy. Well, at least the graduate part is true. I had just joined a new company as a developer and was just getting settled in learning the basics of developing on their internal systems. This was a nice easy entry into the company, and I was enjoying it just fine. 

One day, I get pulled in to a meeting discussing a new FinTech startup client that I could potentially be working on. Amazing! I was one of the first few to be put on a client in the office, and the project was 100% greenfield - everything from the tech stack choices, architecture and, infrastructure (Not that I understood much of that either way).

Fast forward a few hours and my mindset had changed a little:

Along with 2 other developers, we had to build and deploy 4 different containerised NodeJS WebApps to AWS, using container orchestration, best security practices and multiple different testing environments with a fully automated pipeline to Production. All behind a VPN.

From scratch.

<span class="blogpost-highlighted">In 4 weeks. </span>

I was responsible for designing and deploying all our pipelines and infrastructure.<br/>(Imagine a '2 people step back, leaving one in front' sort of situation)

## So what happened?

Needless to say, this wasn't something I expected within the first few weeks of employment. I had barely come across the terms 'pipelines', 'Infrastructure' and 'DevOps', yet I had somehow become the leader within the team for these _fairly_ crucial parts of the delivery of this project. Whilst I had a great support network around me - both technical and personal, going into the project I was naturally terrified from Day 1. 

After an incredibly intense 4 weeks of:
 - Teaching myself AWS, CircleCI, and Docker
 - Creating templates upon templates of CloudFormation
 - (Rigorously) Managing stakeholders
 - Daily sprints

We were finally done. 

Through blood, sweat, and tears we somehow managed to deliver the project. Fully automated pipelines pushing 4 different docker containers through 3 environments with automated testing gates at each level - straight to production. The dream.

But it wasn't all plain sailing. Needless to say I spent most of my time stressing, worrying and generally being anxious over almost everything I had to do. 

<span class="blogpost-highlighted">So what did I learn actually learn along the way?</span>

### 1) You will never know everything
> Simple and obvious, yet incredibly important.

As developers, especially ones new to software delivery, it can be incredibly daunting to see new technologies rise up into the forefront of a developer's code skills only to fade away within a few months/years. Especially with experts seemingly appearing out of nowhere suddenly knowing 'best practice' before you even have a chance to understand what that technology does. 

It's easy to constantly feel behind the curve with libraries and frameworks (Hello Javascript?), and even worse, to then to relate this lack of understanding into a lack of skill.

This will never change. You will never understand everything. 

Harsh words. Unfortunately, chasing the dream that you will eventually 'complete your learning' can lead to feeling inadequate, incompetant, and can allow the general feeling of technical inability to leak into the rest of your work and personal life too.  

<span class="blogpost-highlighted">What can change is the context at which you view your own understanding.</span>

The lenses through which you view your own and others' work will change throughout your career. 

As you learn technologies, you will start to understand the core underlying principles that tie different technologies; be it languages, libraries or software architecture, together. You will start to see patterns emerging and shared concepts between libraries, and understand that the 'magic' you once saw was nothing more than levels of abstractions and software design patterns. You will begin to work on projects you deemed as difficult and easy - terms that become incredibly relative to your own skill. 

As you work in a team, you will start to learn the communication, teamwork and empathy skills that are essential in creating a fantastic work environment. You will start to understand the impact of your work, and how skills and effort not conventionally valued from a developer goes a long way in a team setting. Not only this, but you will learn that skills outside of development vastly impact development skills.  

As you pair program, you will understand the value of timely and constructive feedback - invaluable knowledge that you could not have gained without working with different and diverse groups of people with contrasting minds to your own. You'll gain insights and viewpoints that are infeasible to gain without deep interaction and co-working, and you'll gain these far more rapidly than if you were to work solo.

Of course there are infinite more, but all these wide array of learnings are on a spectrum; you should aim to push yourself on all, however there is no definitive end goal for any.

The important thing is to understand is that whilst we as developers will never know everything, we should all keep striving  and pushing ourselves as if we can. 

### 2) Accept and embrace ambiguity

### 3) Comfort Zones exist, and they need to be challenged

Whatever work you do, it's important to have a base line - some level at which you are comfortable and content with the work you are doing.

This baseline is incredibly important, and should always be in the back of your mind whenever taking on new challenges and workloads - it's your baseline for a reason. Perhaps you feel most at ease when doing repetitive tasks, or perhaps you perform and work best when you are being pressured under intense deadlines. Whatever the baseline is, it is important to never stray too far from it.  


## Blind Confidence is my way of dealing with pressures and difficulties that I cannot understand before actually doing the task itself. 


But the biggest issue I found was <span class="blogpost-highlighted">I wasn't able to understand what direction the project would take</span>. Especially as junior developers who have not been exposed to many technologies


'from zero to containerised hero'.






> Unknown Problems - Being put under pressure to learn new technologies. Pushing above your paygrade. Leading/doing work that you should, delivering a new task/project in a new language you have never used before



### Aims
Aim of this blog is to tell people that not only is it okay to face problems that make you uncomfortable, but it is one of the best ways to learn.

But the most important thing about this whole article is that for some, this is obvious advice. For some, the challenges I faced were minute, perhaps even obstacles they face regularily on a day to day basis. <span class="blogpost-highlighted">However all problems are contextual.</span> The same problem, task or situation is terrifying and full of ambiguity and unknowns for some, whilst for others it is achievable and a solution attainable.
