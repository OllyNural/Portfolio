As developers, we often get put in difficult situations. Whether its finding solutions to distinct and interesting problems, designing complex architecture and code or pushing back on extra features - the list is endless. However, these questions have answers and are approachable. We can ask team members or push back with the help of managers and scrum masters. But what about difficult situations where we don't even know the problem? 

More importantly, how can we _cope_ when faced with them?

## Blind Confidence

> Disclaimer time. As developers, I believe we have a duty to ourselves to push ourselves and learn new technologies and standards. However, this should always come with a good support network, and at a frequency that fits the individual. <span class="blogpost-highlighted">Always put more focus on mental health over productivity and delivering work.</span> 

## Story Time

There I was, a fresh, wide-eyed and eager graduate full of enthusiasm and energy. Well, at least the graduate part is true. I had just joined a new company as a developer and was just getting settled in learning the basics of developing on their internal systems. This was a nice easy entry into the company, and I was enjoying it just fine. 

One day, I get pulled in to a meeting discussing a new FinTech startup client that I could potentially be working on. Amazing! I was one of the first few to be put on a client in the office, and the project was 100% greenfield - everything from the tech stack choices, architecture and, infrastructure (Not that I understood much of that either way).

Fast forward a few hours and my mindset had changed a little:

Along with 2 other developers, we had to build and deploy 4 different containerised NodeJS WebApps to AWS, using container orchestration, best security practices and multiple different testing environments with a fully automated pipeline to Production. All behind a VPN.

From scratch.

<span class="blogpost-highlighted">In 4 weeks. </span>

I was responsible for designing and deploying all our pipelines and infrastructure.<br/>(Imagine a '2 people step back, leaving one in front' sort of situation)

## So what happened?

Needless to say, this wasn't something I expected within the first few weeks of employment. I had barely come across the terms 'pipelines', 'Infrastructure' and 'DevOps', yet I had somehow become the leader within the team for these _fairly_ crucial parts of the delivery of this project. Whilst I had an okay support network around me - mostly technical, going into the project I was naturally terrified from Day 1. 

After an incredibly intense 4 weeks of:
 - Teaching myself AWS, CircleCI, and Docker
 - Creating templates upon templates of CloudFormation
 - (Rigorously) Managing stakeholders
 - Daily sprints

We were finally done. 

Through blood, sweat, and tears we somehow managed to deliver the project. Fully automated pipelines pushing 4 different docker containers through 3 environments with automated testing gates at each level - straight to production. The dream.

But it wasn't all plain sailing. Needless to say I spent most of my time stressing, worrying and generally being anxious over almost everything I had to do. 

<span class="blogpost-highlighted">So what did I learn actually learn along the way?</span>

### 1) You will never know everything
> Simple and obvious, yet incredibly important.

As developers, especially ones new to software delivery, it can be incredibly daunting to see new technologies rise up into the forefront of a developer's code skills only to fade away within a few months/years. Especially with experts seemingly appearing out of nowhere suddenly knowing 'best practice' before you even have a chance to understand what that technology does. 

It's easy to constantly feel behind the curve with libraries and frameworks (Hello Javascript?), and even worse, to then to relate this lack of understanding into a lack of skill.

This will never change. You will never understand everything. 

Harsh words. Unfortunately, chasing the dream that you will eventually 'complete your learning' can lead to feeling inadequate, incompetant, and can allow the general feeling of technical inability to leak into the rest of your work and personal life too.  

<span class="blogpost-highlighted">What can change is the context at which you view your own understanding.</span>

The lenses through which you view your own and others' work will change throughout your career. 

**As you learn technologies**, you will start to understand the core underlying principles that tie different technologies; be it languages, libraries or software architecture, together. You will start to see patterns emerging and shared concepts between libraries, and understand that the 'magic' you once saw was nothing more than levels of abstractions and software design patterns. You will begin to work on projects you deemed as difficult and easy - terms that become incredibly relative to your own skill. 

**As you work in a team**, you will start to learn the communication, teamwork and empathy skills that are essential in creating a fantastic work environment. You will start to understand the impact of your work, and how skills and effort not conventionally valued from a developer goes a long way in a team setting. Not only this, but you will learn that skills outside of development vastly impact development skills.  

**As you pair program**, you will understand the value of timely and constructive feedback - invaluable knowledge that you could not have gained without working with different and diverse groups of people with contrasting minds to your own. You'll gain insights and viewpoints that are infeasible to gain without deep interaction and co-working, and you'll gain these far more rapidly than if you were to work solo.

Of course there are infinite more, but all these wide array of learnings are on a spectrum; you should aim to push yourself on all, however there is no definitive end goal for any.

<span class="blogpost-highlighted">The important thing is to understand is that whilst we as developers will never know everything, we should all keep striving  and pushing ourselves as if we can. </span>

### 2) Accept and embrace ambiguity
> New challenges often represent much more than the nervousness they impart. 

By far the biggest issue I found throughout the project not my technical understanding of tooling, or architecture, or even the behemoth that is AWS. 

<span class="blogpost-highlighted">I wasn't able to understand what direction the project would take.</span> 

Especially as a developer new to almost everything, I was unable to expect what the _project_ would look like in a few days, let alone what the _product_ would look like in a few weeks. 

Whilst the work I did every day seemed uncharted and foreign; the end goal seemed extraterrestrial. It was not just another obscure aim I didn't really understand, it was something I couldn't even comprehend how to begin to think about. 

So in order to deliver I had to embrace that ambiguity. Accept that along with the all mental challenges and difficulties ambiguity brings, there are also many benefits; excuses to experiment and learn technologies and concepts that you would not have had the opportunity to learn before as well as the ability to then pass on this newly found knowledge to other teammates and grow all of your friends and coworkers alongside you.

An incredibly very important aspect of this is _support_. Without a strong support network and foundation, it can be very difficult to keep motivation and confidence when constantly battling with ambiguious and challenging work. Ideally, someone who is more experienced or with a different mindset will be available for help and discussions - especially when you think there is _too many_ unknowns. 

<span class="blogpost-highlighted">Ambiguity forces us to either find solutions or get answers to difficult questions. We may not always be able to work through these on our own, but we should be confident approaching vague and uncertain problems, and working towards a solution.</span>

### 3) Comfort Zones exist, and they need to be challenged
> "Work somewhere between swimming happily in the ocean and being chased by Sharks" - Jo Crossick

> <span class="blogpost-highlighted">This is based around
[The Learning Zone Model](http://www.thempra.org.uk/social-pedagogy/key-concepts-in-social-pedagogy/the-learning-zone-model/).</span> 

In my eyes, this can be quite a dangerous topic to discuss - especially when describing how hard to push yourself and others. This is by no means a qualified opinion, it's simply what worked for me. As an action from this, I urge you to think about where you are currently sitting in the Learning Zone, and where you believe you should be. 

Whatever work you do, it's necessary to have a base line - some level at which you are comfortable and content with the work you are doing. 

This baseline is incredibly important, and should always be in the back of your mind whenever taking on new challenges and workloads - it's your baseline for a reason. Perhaps you feel most at ease when doing repetitive tasks, or perhaps you perform and work best when you are being pressured under intense deadlines. However, if you stay at your baseline, you will also stagnate.

If you are constantly doing tasks you understand or tasks you find comfortable doing, on the surface you will feel content. But you will never be learning nor growing. If you are not learning new design patterns, architectural decisions, DevOps practices etc, then you will not be growing and learning as an individual. 

It will be difficult, you'll face challenges you won't immediately understand or be able to solve, but those are the periods in which you will grow the most as a developer and as a problem solver. 

You cannot begin to learn new technologies without starting from effectively nothing. This is what the term Blind Confidence represents:

Understanding that it is perfectly okay to go into problems with absolutely no idea of how to solve them, but it is not okay to go in without confidence in your own ability to solve them.

## <span class="blogpost-highlighted">Blind Confidence is my way of dealing with pressures and difficulties that I cannot understand before actually doing the task itself. </span>

I urge you all to consider where you are right now, where you want to be, and what unknown challenges you will try to face in order to get you there.
